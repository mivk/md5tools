- rename to md5dirs, since "all" is misleading"

- options: better use of -d debug option, add -v verbose, add -n dry-run, ...?

- if .md5 file exists, try to check if it's complete?

- option for -f current-dir-name ?

- test on MacOS with Bash 3

- accept multiple dirs arg.

- option to skip DCPs

- exit if 0 folders to process (when all skipped)


Done:?
- must have argument.
- bug with dirs.
- cd back to start when finished
- reject $dir = "/"
- check dir exists
